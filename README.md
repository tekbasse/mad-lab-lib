Mad Laboratory Tcl and graphics library
---------------------------------------

For experimenter's with limited computing hardware resources

This software consists mainly of a library of 
Tcl procedures and demo for quickly building software
tools for analyzing and reporting results of custom experiments.

The software requires Tcl and GraphicsMagick, both are capable 
of running on most any older 32-bit (and newer)  systems.

About Tcl: 

"Many have called it the 'best-kept secret in the software industry'. 

..easy to learn and easy to deploy!" (from: http://www.tcl.tk/about/ )

About GraphicsMagick:

"GraphicsMagick is the swiss army knife of image processing. 

..it provides a robust and efficient collection of tools and libraries 
which support reading, writing, and manipulating an image in 
over 88 major formats including important formats like 
DPX, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, PNM, and TIFF."
